# Azure Windows Server Lab (Multi-Stage SysAdmin Project)

This repo documents a four-part iterative lab project I completed using Microsoft Azure and Windows Server 2025. It follows the full lifecycle of deploying, configuring, and securing a cloud-hosted domain controller ‚Äî covering core sysadmin responsibilities including Active Directory setup, user/group management, firewall rules, and scheduled automation.

Completed as part of my IT System Administration coursework at Ensign College.

## üß≠ Project Progression

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ‚úÖ 1 | **Azure VM Deployed** (Windows Server 2025, RDP enabled, auto-shutdown configured) |
| ‚úÖ 2 | **Promoted to Domain Controller** (`ensign.corp` created, verified login as domain admin) |
| ‚úÖ 3 | **Configured Active Directory** (Users + OUs, NTFS folder structure, permission mapping) |
| ‚úÖ 4 | **Secured and Automated** (Firewall rules on port 50000, scheduled daily updates via Task Scheduler) |

## üé• Video Walkthroughs

Each stage includes a narrated video demo and a transcript.
